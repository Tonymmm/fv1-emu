Hi Eduard,

We do not officially endorse any 3rd party products but we do not object to open source products that support the FV-1. Digital Larry made SpinCad http://holycityaudio.com/spincad-designer-2/ and released it open source and talks about it on our forum. Others share code, etc. 

Best regards,

Subject: FV-1 emulation project (opensource)

Hello Spin Semiconductor,

I am the developer of the FV-1 emulator module for VCV Rack.

I would like to release the module for free as a open source project.

The Idea behind the project is reusing/developing FV-1 programs in a virtual environment (VCV Rack). Also understanding the internal functionality of the FV-1 from source code (I know the emulation is not completely correct).

I would like to get your approval or any hints I have to consider publishing the project on github.

At the moment, I have a lot of references to your knowledgebase/documentation.

Thank you and best regards
